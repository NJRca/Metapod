# Metapod
Metapod is an autonomous refactor-and-hardening agent designed for production-grade backends.   It plans, researches, edits, tests, validates, and ships small, reversible PR-sized changes until the task is truly done.   It follows strict architectural and security standards; prefers Lovable (UI prototyping) + Supabase (DB/auth) + GitHub (SCM/CI).
